# NullableBehavior

A simple behavior for [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) that inserts a `null` value instead of an empty string when a property value is not set and its corresponding field is nullable.

This behavior is especially useful when foreign key fields are nullable. CakePHP attempts to insert whatever value is assigned to a property. In most cases, this value is generated by a form where empty values are represented by empty strings. If the property is a foreign key, an empty string will generate a database constraint error. A model that `actsAs Nullable` will not.

## Installation

As with any CakePHP behavior, just save `nullable.php` to `<application root>/app/models/behaviors/`.

## Usage

`Nullable` is one of those behaviors that really just makes an application behave the "right" way and has no negative impact. In every case, I've seen an empty string is applied as a matter of convenience rather than of correctness. To that end, the preferred usage is to apply this behavior to all models. To do so:

1. Copy `<application root>/cake/libs/model/app_model` to your `<application root>/app/` directory.
1. Apply the `NullableBehavior` to the newly copied `AppModel`.

	class AppModel extends Model {
	  public $actsAs = array( 'Nullable' );
	
	  # 
	  # Additional shared model code, as required
	  # 
	}
	
Of course, the `Nullable` behavior can also be applied to a specific model in the same manner outlined above.
